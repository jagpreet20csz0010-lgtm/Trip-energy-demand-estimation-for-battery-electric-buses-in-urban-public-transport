# Trip-energy-demand-estimation-for-battery-electric-buses-in-urban-public-transport

Battery electric buses (BEBs) are increasingly used in urban public transport systems as a cleaner and more energy-efficient alternative to conventional buses. For these buses to operate reliably, it is important to estimate how much energy they will need for each trip. Trip energy demand estimation helps transport agencies plan battery sizes, schedule charging, and design appropriate charging infrastructure.

## Features
- Data and code to estimate trip energy demand of BEBs
- Includes route characteristics such as speed, passenger load, duration, stops, and ambient temperature
- Example scripts to reproduce results

## Requirements
